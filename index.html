    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? 
      Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">Internet is a big thing today, and it also then attracts people that want to take advantage of it. So your webpage is vulnerable to every variable that contains information. Most of the security breaches can be stopped by using third party services like different Web Frameworks which may ensure that:
      -User-data written in queries is escaped, to protect the data about users to be stolen. This is done by escaping the text inputted, to not allow script codes to be written.
      -Html is sanitized to not allow it to include script, object, embed and link
      - Stop an attacker from making a customers stored browser data to allow a transaction. A hidden “secret” will make it impossible for them to target anyone without knowing that info for the specific customer too.
      
      Making your customer use good passwords, will make it less likely that their info is lost in a data breach before you can alert them. A long password is the best recommendation.
      Make your page use http to encrypt info between you  and customer, to hide from a possible “middle guy”. Having the keylock symbol in your browser during sensitive pages, is very important for the customer to actually proceed through those critical pages. This is easy to implement.
      You can also use “vulnerability scanning tools” to automatically check your page for security risks. Remember that most holes can be hacked for fun after people have been watching tutorials on youtube, and you don’t want your reputation crushed by a leak.
